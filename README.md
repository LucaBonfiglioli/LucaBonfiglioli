# Hello 👋

Hi, I am Luca and I work as software engineer at [Eyecan.ai](https://eyecan.ai) :rocket:. 

# Projects and Research 🧪

I am something between a scientist and an engineer, meaning that I often have to switch between pure software development and scientific research. 
A list of projects that I have worked on, including both development projects and research:

## Pipelime 🍋

[Pipelime](https://github.com/eyecan-ai/pipelime-python.git) is a pretty handy **python library to automate data pipelines**. We designed it to be
as flexible as possible and to fit to every possible use case. It also comes with a DSL to post-process config files, which I personally maintain. Check it out!

## Eyecandies 🍬

[Eyecandies](https://eyecan-ai.github.io/eyecandies) is a fully synthetic, multi-modal, multi-light dataset for unsupervised **anomaly detection** with automatically labelled ground-truth annotations. It was published with an ACCV 2022 paper. Send us your results!

## NNViz 🔍

[NNViz](https://github.com/lucabonfiglioli/nnviz) is a neural network visualization tool that can be used to quickly inspect the insides of a neural network. Currently works on pytorch models and renders them as PDFs. NNviz is borderline toy-project, but I plan to maintain it over time. 

## Pipewine 🍷

[Pipewine](https://lucabonfiglioli.github.io/pipewine) is a complete rewrite of the Pipelime library aimed at improving various aspects of the original design including type safety, reducing dependencies, decoupling and rethinking various library components.
