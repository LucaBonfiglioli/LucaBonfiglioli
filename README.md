# Hello

Hi, I am Luca and I work as software engineer at [Eyecan.ai](https://eyecan.ai) :rocket:. 
I specialize in technological singularities, developed a bunch of them in my garage - but I cannot show them to you. 

My main interests are Computer Vision and Computer Graphics, and I really enjoy automating stuff.

# Projects and Research

A list of projects that I have worked on:

## Pipelime

[Pipelime](https://github.com/eyecan-ai/pipelime-python.git) is a pretty handy **python library to automate data pipelines**. We designed it to be
as flexible as possible and to fit to every possible use case. It also comes with a DSL to post-process config files, which I personally maintain. Check it out!

## Eyecandies

[Eyecandies](https://eyecan-ai.github.io/eyecandies) is a fully synthetic, multi-modal, multi-light dataset for unsupervised **anomaly detection** with automatically labelled ground-truth annotations. It was published with an ACCV 2022 paper. Send us your results!
